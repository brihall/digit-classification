# digit-classification
To run -  
Add all .m files as well as zip.train and zip.test to the same directory. Navigate to the directory in MATLAB. Call OneThreeFive in the MATLAB console. The script calls BaggedTrees.m (where most of the actual work is done) and tree_test_error.m to learn the models and find the test errors. Out-of-bag and test errors will be printed to the console and graphs of number of trees vs. out-of-bag error for one-vs-three and three-vs-five will be displayed.<br><br>
If you don't have access to MATLAB that's completely fine. The results are summarized in the PDF report included in the repository, and you can still look over the included .m files. If the class that assigned this project hadn't required us to use MATLAB I probably would have used Python instead.
