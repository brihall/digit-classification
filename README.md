# handwritten-digits
To run -  
Add all .m files as well as zip.train and zip.test to the same directory. Navigate to the directory in MATLAB. Call OneThreeFive in the MATLAB console. The script calls BaggedTrees.m and tree_test_error.m to learn the model and find the test error. Out-of-bag and test errors will be printed to the console and graphs of number of trees vs. out-of-bag error for one-vs-three and three-vs-five will be displayed.
